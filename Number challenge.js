/* Question: Create a variable called `x` that is a random number between 1 and 100 along with a variable called `y` that is a random number between 1 and 50.

Create a variable for the sum, difference, product, quotient and remainder of `x` and `y`. Log the output in a string that shows the two numbers of `x` and `y` along with the operator and result. */


// code
let x = Math.floor(Math.random()*100 +1);
let y = Math.floor(Math.random()*50+1);

const sum = x+y;
const difference = x-y;
const product = x*y;
const quotient = x/y;
const remainder = x%y;
console.log(`${x} + ${y} = ${sum}`);
console.log(`${x} - ${y} = ${difference}`);
console.log(`${x} * ${y} = ${product}`);
console.log(`${x} / ${y} = ${quotient}`);
console.log(`${x} % ${y} = ${remainder}`);
